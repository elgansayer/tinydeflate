Note: The latest, full featured version of tinydeflate is now included in [miniz.c](http://code.google.com/p/miniz/), which had its beginnings with tinydeflate.cpp. Unless there's interest I'm no longer updating tinydeflate - miniz.c compresses better and is much more tested.

tinydeflate is a fast, fully functional and concise [Deflate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate) (RFC 1951) and basic [zlib](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-zlib.html) (RFC 1950) implementation in a single ~700 line C++ source file [tinydeflate.cpp](http://code.google.com/p/tinydeflate/source/browse/trunk/tinydeflate.cpp). The core compression class supports streaming and memory to memory compression, makes no heap allocations, and performs similar to [zlib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) when measured by ratio or throughput. A small function to write compressed [PNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) image files is also included.

Important: This is a not a fully tested release, and the code has only been compiled with MSVC 2008. Once it's fully tested I'll release a source archive containing an example app and update this page with usage information. For now I've only released [tinydeflate.cpp](http://code.google.com/p/tinydeflate/source/browse/trunk/tinydeflate.cpp).
